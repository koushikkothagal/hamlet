{"name":"Hamlet","tagline":"An AngularJS A/B testing framework","body":"### *To B, or to A? That's the question*\r\n\r\nHamlet is an AngularJS A/B testing framework. Plug in Hamlet to your AngularJS application to test multiple variants of content on any page.\r\n\r\n### Features\r\nHamlet supports the following features:\r\n\r\n1. Supports testing multiple variations. Hamlet is not just an A/B testing framework. It's an A/B/C/D/... testing framework!\r\n2. Show different portions of content to different audiences *on the same page*. Supports DOM element level variations.\r\n3. Control ratio of how much of the audience needs to see each variation. \r\n4. Stickiness. Let Hamlet know an ID / session value that identifies a unique user, and Hamlet ensures stickiness. Once a user sees a version, they'll always see the same version, even in multiple browsers.\r\n\r\n### How to use\r\n\r\n1. Identify a value (some sort of user ID) that uniquely identifies your users.\r\n2. Create multiple branches (up to 10 branches) by adding a `<div>` for each branch, and add code your variants.\r\n3. Configure ratios (0 - 1) for each branch to control how many of your users see each branch.\r\n\r\nAnd Hamlet does the rest\r\n\r\n```html\r\n<div ab-test ab-test-qualifier=\"{{userId}}\">\r\n  <div test-branch ratio=\"0.1\">\r\n    <h4>Branch 1</h4>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div test-branch ratio=\"0.6\">\r\n    <h4>Branch 2</h4>\r\n  </div>\r\n  <div test-branch ratio=\"0.3\">\r\n    <h4>Branch 3</h4>\r\n  </div>\r\n</div>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Get Hamlet\r\n\r\n#### Bower\r\n```\r\nbower install hamlet\r\n```\r\n### JS / Source\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/koushikkothagal/hamlet\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\n@koushikkothagal\r\n\r\n","google":"UA-52497694-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
